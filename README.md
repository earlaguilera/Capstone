hi Team,
follow these instructions to run this application

first make a new mongo database called meanauth. thats it, you don't have to create a collection.
then
1. run npm install inside parent folder
2. cd into angularsrc and run npm install there
3. run ng build command
4. go back to parent folder
5. run node app.js

it should be running in localhost:3000
register a test user and then login.

hope it works
